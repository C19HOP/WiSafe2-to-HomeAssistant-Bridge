When the alarm wants to send data to a radio, like when alarm is triggered or test button is pressed, then alarm pulls IRQ (pin8) high (normally low).
IRQ goes high, the radio (master) responds by sending _SS low and running the clock.
One byte is sent from alarm to radio, then _SS returns high.
IRQ goes low then high for the next byte.


When radio wants to transmit to alarm, like when the other alarms go off...
_SS is brought low. Clock runs and byte is sent from SDO (pin6).
_SS then returns high. Alarm seems to ACK with a pulse on IRQ (pin8).
_SS then goes low again and next byte is sent
